## 🛠️ Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Python** (if you don't have it installed already):

   - For **Windows**:
     - Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
     - Make sure to check the option **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

   - For **macOS/Linux**:
     - Check if Python is already installed by running:
       ```bash
       python3 --version
       ```
     - If it's not installed, you can install Python 3 using your package manager:
       - For **macOS**: `brew install python`
       - For **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install python3`
       - For **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install python3`
   
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Judewakim/LUIT-Python1.git
   ```

3. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LUIT-Python1
   ```

4. Install any necessary dependencies (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   _Note: If there are no external dependencies, you can skip this step._ 🚫

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

To run the scripts, simply execute them in your terminal:

1. `hello_world.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 hello_world.py
   ```

2. `name_generator.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 name_generator.py
   ```

3. `main.py`:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

If you are using **Windows** and have Python 3 installed as the default `python` command, you can substitute `python3` with `python` in the above commands. Example:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

Each script is designed to demonstrate basic Python functionality, making them ideal for beginners. 💡
