#Several departments share an AWS environment. 
#You need to ensure that the EC2s are properly named and are unique so team members can easily tell who the EC2 instances belong to. 
#Use Python to create your unique EC2 names that the users can then attach to the instances. 

#FOUNDATIONAL
#The Python Script should:
#Allow the user to input how many EC2 instances they want names for and output the same amount of unique names.
#Allow the user to input the name of their department that is used in the unique name.
#Generate random characters and numbers that will be included in the unique name.
#Push your code to GitHub and include the link in your LinkedIn write up.
#ADVANCED
#The only departments that should use this Name Generator are the Marketing, Accounting, and FinOps Departments. 
#List these departments as options and if a user puts another department, print a message that they should not use this Name Generator. 
#Be sure to account for incorrect upper or lowercase letters in the correct department. 
#Example: a user inputs accounting vs Accounting.
#COMPLEX
#Turn the above into a Function and execute the Function to verify it works
